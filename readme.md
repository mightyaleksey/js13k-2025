## Design

This time I decided to make a logic game and ended up in building variation of the match-3 game. To keep it entertaining I made rotation logic.

Wanted (but did not made) to make a health concept for the stones (pieces) as wall, so those will get damaged and removed after new stones fall on those. However, due to limited time ended up in endless puzzle game :D
